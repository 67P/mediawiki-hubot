# MediaWiki Hubot

This MediaWiki extension sends notifications for common actions to Hubot chat
bots via the [hubot-incoming-webhook](https://github.com/67P/hubot-incoming-webhook)
plugin/endpoint. That means you can send notiications to e.g. an IRC channel of
your choice, if you have a Hubot connected to it.

The code is adapted from the [Slack Media
Wiki](https://github.com/kulttuuri/slack_mediawiki) extension.
